 the language models were trained separately on each game genre's descriptions, so they learned the unique vocabulary, themes, and writing style typical for that category. So, it makes sense that the results are different.
Action games tend to focus on combat, opponents, and missions, whereas adventure games describe exploration, characters, and stories. RPGs involve fantasy themes and character progression. Each genre has distinctive elements reflected in the language.
